# CharecterSheetTracker
This is Fifth Edition Character Sheet tracker, to help fill int character sheets for personal use.

This was created to run locally, it's not optimized to be ran as a web application.  It saves the information in app data.

I'm creating it for personal use for me and the players in my party.

I decided to share this version of it because I don't think it contains anything that isn't covered in the basic rules.
